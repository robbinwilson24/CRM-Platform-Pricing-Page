## Description <a name="description"/>
This is a pricing page for a fictitious CRM platform, designed to demonstrate my ability to effectively use HTML and CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design. The page features three pricing tiers, each with its own set of features and benefits.


## Technologies Used <a name="technologies"/>
The following technologies were used to create this pricing page:
    - HTML
    - CSS


## Features <a name="features"/>
The pricing page has the following features:
    - Reactive design that changes based on screen size, thanks to the use of media queries.
    - A gradient background
    - Reactive spans that look like buttons and make use of the pseudo classes of hover and focus 
    
    
## Installation and Usage <a name="installation"/>
To install the CRM-Platform-Pricing-Page repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine.

The CRM-Platform-Pricing-Page is a static page, and therefore does not require any additional setup or configuration. Simply open the index.html file in your web browser to view the pricing page.


Credits <a name="credits"/>
This program was coded by myself, with elements of guidance from Colt Steele in his Web Development bootcamp (Which he had based on work by Travis Williamson). I aimed to recreate his page on my own and managed to come pretty close to the final product. 
I then added my own elements to it to improve on it.
